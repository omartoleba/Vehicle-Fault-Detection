# 📖 Overview

Modern vehicles rely on multiple Electronic Control Units (ECUs) that communicate continuously to monitor sensors, control actuators, and detect system faults.

The **Vehicle Fault Detection & Logging System (VFDLS)** simulates this real-world automotive architecture by implementing two independent ECUs communicating over UART.

The project continuously monitors vehicle subsystems, detects abnormal conditions, stores Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) in external EEPROM, and allows the driver to retrieve fault information through a keypad-controlled LCD interface.

This project was developed as the **Final Capstone Project** for the **Standard Embedded Systems Diploma** at **Edges for Training**.
